# Handwritten Digit Recognition ✍️🔢

This project implements a **Handwritten Digit Recognition** system using **Deep Learning**. It leverages the **MNIST dataset** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9).

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is designed to recognize handwritten digits using advanced image processing and deep learning techniques. The key steps involved are:
- Preprocessing handwritten digit images
- Building and training a CNN model for classification
- Evaluating the model’s performance on test data
- Deploying the model for real-world digit recognition

## 🚀 Features
✅ Utilizes the **MNIST dataset** for training and testing  
✅ Implements a **CNN architecture** using **TensorFlow/Keras**  
✅ Achieves **high accuracy** in digit recognition  
✅ Supports **real-time predictions** for user-input images  
✅ Provides a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for easy interaction  

## 👨‍💻 Usage
To use the real-time digit recognition system, follow these steps:
1. Run the `HW.ipynb` file.
2. Run `app.py` to open the graphical interface(in bash run (streamlit run app.py).
3. Upload an image of a handwritten digit.
4. The system will process the image and predict the digit with high accuracy.
